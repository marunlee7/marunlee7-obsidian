## A Reduced Design for an Uncluttered Desktop

## WHY WE DESIGNED IT

Working long hours at a laptop can be tiring, and create a serious strain on your back and neck. When used on a desk your laptop screen is usually positioned much too low. Your neck or back inevitably need to bend. The advantage of mobility of a laptop has its trade-off.

The Yohann MacBook stand follows general recommendations for ergonomic use. The stand enables you to position the top edge of your MacBook screen level with your eyes in an elegant way. It helps you to keep your head balanced on your spine and reduces the strain on your neck and back, allowing for a more comfortable experience throughout your day.

***“Use a separate keyboard and mouse so the laptop can be put on a stand and the screen opened at eye level.”***

[British National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/workplacehealth/Pages/laptophealth.aspx)

***“In order to prevent premature fatigue and health damages the height of the display should be adjusted in a way that it’s top edge is positioned to eye level.”***

[Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.cms.hu-berlin.de/de/dl/vwedv/empfehlg/hardware/ergonomie/bsanford_htm)

## WHAT YOU GET

UPRIGHT SITTING POSTURE

The Yohann MacBook stand elevates your screen by 15 to 22 cm / 6 to 9 inches, depending on your MacBook model. By using a separate keyboard and mouse it allows you to easily maintain an upright and relaxed sitting posture, with a more balanced positioning for your head and neck.

STURDY SUPPORT

It’s been designed and engineered to provide a stable support for MacBooks of different sizes. The footprint is dimensioned to ensure great stability, when used in open screen and in closed ‘clamshell’ mode alongside an external display. A smooth leather pad distributes the weight evenly along the entire width of 16 cm.

SLEEP MODE

To put your MacBook to [sleep](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202824), simply close the display. Although the MacBook will not close completely, it will enter sleep mode.

KEEP IT TIDY

The space-saving MacBook stand lets you keep your desk tidy and clutter-free. Its light design makes your workspace feel just good. You can stow away your MacBook easily, by lowering the screen and putting it into sleep mode. Then when you’re ready to use it again, simply open the lid and start working straight away.

OPTIMAL COOLING

The elevated and free position of your MacBook helps to keep it ideally cooled. Get always the best performance, whether with opened or closed display.

CLOSED-DISPLAY MODE

The MacBook stand is designed to also be used in [closed-display mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834)  or  [closed-clamshell mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834) with a separate external display while keeping the MacBook closed. The ideal cooling conditions provided by Yohann MacBook stand are essential for a good performance when operating in this mode.

## DESIGN THOUGHTS

The Yohann MacBook stand is a resolute combination of high functionality with a reduced design.

The general shape reflects its three basic functions. It is streamlined to provide the ideal elevation of your screen while providing best stability and ventilation for your MacBook in a reduced and light way. This was achieved and optimized by a structural calculation and by optically reducing its body to the minimum needed. The monolithic design sustains high stability and rigidity and a clean sculptural appearance.  
Forces on the MacBook are minimized due to the even distribution along the entire width of 16 cm.

COOLING

The MacBook stand helps the two cooling mechanisms, that are used in a MacBook to work more effectively. The basic aluminium design of the Apple MacBook acts as a heat exchange between its surface and the environment, so we reduce the surface contact between your MacBook and its stand. The elevated positioning allows the MacBook surface to freely radiate and to get rid of excessive heat very efficiently. Its secondary cooling mechanism, the MacBook’s rear ventilation system remains unobstructed, so it can freely exhaust hot air with minimum effort.

Yohann MacBook Pro and MacBook stand is a carefully crafted little piece of furniture for your Apple laptop. If you work long hours on your MacBook and appreciate distinctive design and a clean workspace, it will definitely be a good choice for both your health and your eyes.

The Yohann stand is specially designed to support your MacBook sturdily and securely. You could even type on the keyboard and use the trackpad. However, the MacBook Stand is primarily designed for use with a separate keyboard and mouse, to keep your back and neck in the ideal posture. The fusion of elegance and stability is a primary principle of our product design. The stand is optically reduced and slender and provides minimalist beauty and sturdiness at the same time.

Using a stand for your MacBook can offer several benefits:

1\. Ergonomics: A stand can help improve your posture and reduce strain on your neck and back by raising the screen to eye level. If you spend a significant amount of time working on your MacBook, using a stand with an external keyboard and mouse can provide a more comfortable and ergonomic setup.

2\. Cooling and Airflow: Stands can help promote better airflow around your MacBook, which can assist in keeping it cool during intensive tasks. Lifting the laptop off the surface can allow for improved ventilation and heat dissipation, potentially helping to prevent overheating.

4\. Space Optimization: If you have limited desk space, a stand can help free up valuable real estate by elevating your MacBook off the surface. This allows you to utilize the space beneath the laptop for other items.

Ultimately, it's a matter of personal preference and your specific needs. If you value improved ergonomics, cooling, or space optimization, using a stand can be beneficial.

Yes, it is generally safe to use a vertical stand for your MacBook. Vertical stands or risers are designed specifically to hold laptops in an elevated position, and to provide good stability.

When choosing a MacBook riser, it's important to select one that is compatible with your MacBook model and size. The Yohann MacBook stands are optimized for all current MacBooks, MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs.

Additionally, be cautious of any potential hazards in your environment that could cause the stand or MacBook to fall over, such as uneven surfaces or excessive vibrations. It's important to place the stand on a stable surface and take precautions to avoid any accidental knocks or bumps that could dislodge the laptop from the stand.

Yes, the Yohann MacBook Stand works fine for all current MacBook Pros since 2015 and all MacBook Airs.

Find a list of the compatible MacBook Models on the top right, below the Add to cart button.

In general, our stands are made for Apple MacBooks and MacBook Pros. However, they also work fine for many other laptops.

1. The thickness of the front part of your laptop, which is touching the stand, should not be thicker than 14 mm.
2. The laptop should have a relatively stable general construction.
3. The front edge should be rather angular and should look similar to the MacBook or MacBook Pro.
4. The size should be within the range of the MacBook familiy.
