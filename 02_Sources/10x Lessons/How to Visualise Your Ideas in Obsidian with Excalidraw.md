//Description  
In today's video, I'll show you how I visually brainstorm eight of my best book ideas using Obsidian and the Excalidraw plugin. If you're an Obsidian user looking to make your notes more engaging and spark creativity, this video is for you!  
  
We'll dive into a simple, yet effective workflow for brainstorming and visualizing your notes. This won't be an in-depth Excalidraw tutorial, but I hope it inspires you to experiment with visual note-taking and unlock creativity in your own Obsidian vault. Join me as we start creating visually appealing notes in Obsidian.
