# 500 Miles - Inside Llewyn Davis

If you miss the train I'm on,
You will know that I am gone
You can gear the whistle blow a hundred miles
a hundred miles, a hundred miles,
a hundred miles, a hundred miles,
You can gear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two,
Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four
Lord I'm 500 miles from my home
500 miles, 500miles, 500miles, 500miles
Lord I'm fove hundred miles from my home

Not a shirt on my back,
not a penny to my name
Lord I can't go a-home this a-way
This a-away, this a-way,
this a-way, this a-way
Lord I can't go a-home this a-way

If you miss the train I'm on,
You will know that I am gone
You can gear the whistle blow a hundred miles
