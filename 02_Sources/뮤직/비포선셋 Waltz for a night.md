# 비포선셋 Waltz for a Night

Let me sing you a waltz out of
nowhere out of my thoughts
Let me sing you a waltz about
this one night stand
you were for me that night
everything I always
dreamt of in life
but now you're gone
you are far gone
all the way to you island of rain
it was for you just a one
night thing
but you were much more to me
just so you know
I hear a rumors about you
about all about things you do
but when we were together alone
you didn't seem like a player at all
I don't care what they say
I know what you meant
for me that day
I just wanted another try I just
wanted another night
even if it doesn't seem
quite right
you meant for me much more than
anyone I've met before
one single night with you
little Jesse is worth
thousand with anybody
I have no bitterness my sweet
I'll never forget this one night
thing even tomorrow in other arms
my heart will stay yours
until I die
Let me sing you a waltz out of
nowhere out of my blues
Let me sing you a waltz about
this lovely one night stand
